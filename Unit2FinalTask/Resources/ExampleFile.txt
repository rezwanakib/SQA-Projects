If you work with files in your automation test you change download folder. In this case it's Resources folder
But when we work with Git it can't save empty folders.
So that's why you need to do some actions if you have test with downolad/upload files.
1) Create Resources folder in your solution (in this repository it is already created, so you can see how it should be done)
2) Add some example .txt file inside of this folder
3) In your Visual Studio Solution explorer right click on created .txt file
4) "Properties" -> "Copy to output directory" value should be changed to "Copy always"

After these actions your code will work on your local computer and on another computers (for example when mentor reviews your code).
